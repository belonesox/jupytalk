    I discovered two libraries based on
    :epkg:`matplotlib`. The first one
    :ref:`implotninerst` proposes a different way
    to create graphs. The second one adresses
    a typical issue for a statisticians which is plotting
    a density estimated with lots of points
    :ref:`immplscatterdensityrst`.
